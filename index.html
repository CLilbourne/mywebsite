        Hey, I'm Connor Lilbourne

        <h2> Why the Website? </h2>
        <p>
            I am looking for a job in AI, Machine Learning and Data Analysis, this serves as a resume and repository for my projects.
        </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Connor! I’m deeply interested in computer science, with a particular passion for data analysis and the exciting world of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I love uncovering insights from data and building intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems whether it's through predictive models, automation, or smart visualizations.

            <br><br>Outside of my academic and professional interests, I’m an avid fan of video games and the esports scene. My favourite games currently are fortnite, league of legends and rust.  I enjoy following competitive gaming and exploring how technology and analytics are shaping the future of the industry. I’m also a huge football enthusiast… you may already know this by looking at some of my daily projects… Go Rams!!
    
        </p>
        <h3>Old Projects</h3>
        <p>
            Work in Progress...
        </p>
        <h2>My Daily Learning Series</h2>
        <p>
            The Daily Series is a personal learning project where I commit to completing and sharing one project, experiment, or concept each day. The goal is simple, learn something new daily whether it's in computer science, data, AI, or something entirely unrelated and to make that learning public.
Each post serves two purposes. 
<br><br>First, it’s a record of my continuous growth that I can go back to and use for future projects.
 Second, and more importantly, it's a resource for anyone reading.
 Someone might discover something new, pick up a helpful tip, or use my code as a springboard for your own work.
 Thirdly, it keeps my brain active and forces me to upkeep my brain with some sort of responsibility.
  Whether the project takes 30 minutes or several hours, the focus is on progress, curiosity, and sharing knowledge in a way that’s accessible and reusable.
